In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. The strategy pattern
* defines a family of algorithms,
* encapsulates each algorithm, and
* makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.
